    description: "The first-generation Volvo XC60 was introduced as a compact luxury crossover SUV positioned between the XC70 and XC90 in Volvo's lineup. Built on Ford's EUCD platform shared with the S80 and V70, it featured distinctive styling with a coupe-like roofline, a bold shoulder line, and Volvo's signature tail lamps. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included various five and six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, with the T6 model featuring a turbocharged inline-six producing around 300 horsepower. All models featured all-wheel drive as standard or optional, enhancing the vehicle's all-weather capability. The interior showcased Scandinavian design with Volvo's floating center console, high-quality materials, and intuitive controls. Safety was a major selling point, with the XC60 introducing City Safety, Volvo's low-speed automatic braking system, as standard equipmentâ€”a first in the industry. A significant facelift in 2013 updated the exterior styling and interior features, while also introducing new, more efficient four-cylinder Drive-E engines to certain markets. The first-generation XC60 proved to be Volvo's most popular model globally, successfully blending practicality, safety, and premium features in a right-sized package that appealed to luxury crossover buyers."

    description: "The second-generation Volvo XC60, introduced for the 2018 model year, is built on Volvo's Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform shared with the 90-series models. The exterior design evolved Volvo's design language with more refined proportions, distinctive Thor's Hammer LED headlights, and a more athletic stance while maintaining recognizable XC60 styling cues. The interior represents a significant upgrade with premium materials, minimalist Scandinavian design centered around a 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen, and exceptional attention to detail. A key departure from the previous generation is the exclusive use of four-cylinder engines across the range, with various levels of electrification: T5 (turbocharged) and T6 (turbo and supercharged) petrol engines, D4 and D5 diesels in some markets, and T8 Twin Engine plug-in hybrid variants producing up to 400 combined horsepower. Later updates introduced 48-volt mild hybrid technology across most of the range. Safety and driver assistance technology reached new heights with Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, advanced collision avoidance, and numerous other features that earned the XC60 top safety ratings worldwide. A refresh in 2021 brought subtle design updates and a transition to Google-based infotainment systems. The second-generation XC60 has continued as Volvo's best-selling model globally, successfully balancing luxury, technology, efficiency, and safety in a competitive segment, while receiving numerous industry awards including 2018 World Car of the Year."
